## Design 

### Color Scheme

I have decided on these 3 colours in order to maintain consistency in color usage and to ensure there is enough contrast between text and background for good readability.
The color pallete has been created on [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

### Fonts
The fonts selection was 'Montserrat' and 'Fira Sans' , I have imported them from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and I believe it blended perfectly with the vision for the website and different type of font-weights applied.

## Existing Features

   ### Navigation Bar

  - Featured on all three pages : Masterclass, Gallery & Register, the full responsive navigation bar is identical in each page to allow the user easy navigation from page to page.
  - The navigation bar has a fixed position, ensuring it stays at the top of the page along with a burger icon with a dropdown menu; this has been incorporated on mobile screens, offering a more mobile-friendly approach to click the menu options.
  
  #### Call-to-Action
  - A hyperlink added to JOIN US, a call-to-action, inviting users to register.
